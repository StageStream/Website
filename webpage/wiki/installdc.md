# How to Install Docker Compose on Common Linux Distributions

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. This guide covers the installation process on the most common Linux distributions.

## Prerequisites
- A user with sudo privileges
- Docker installed on your system (if not, install it using your distribution's package manager)
- `curl` and `wget` installed (can be installed via your package manager)

## Install Docker Compose

### 1. Download the Latest Docker Compose Binary
The recommended method is to download the latest binary from Dockerâ€™s official GitHub repository.

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Alternatively, if `curl` is not available, use `wget`:
```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/docker-compose "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"
```

### 2. Apply Executable Permissions
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### 3. Verify Installation
```bash
docker-compose --version
```

## Installing Docker Compose via Package Manager
Some distributions provide Docker Compose in their package repositories. However, these versions may be outdated.

### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker-compose -y
```

### Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install docker-compose -y
```

### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S docker-compose
```

## Alternative: Install via Pip
If you have Python and Pip installed, you can install Docker Compose via Pip:
```bash
pip install docker-compose
```
To ensure global availability:
```bash
sudo ln -s ~/.local/bin/docker-compose /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

For more details, refer to the [official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
